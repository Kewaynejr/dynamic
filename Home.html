                    Delvon utilizes Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques to help clients address issues like anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and other life issues which can create a set of DYNAMICS.
                    <div class="padding"></div>
                    About CBT:
                    <br />
                    CBT was introduced to the world of counseling psychology by Aaron Beck with other  behaviorist  in the field of psychology.
                    <br />
                    CBT operates around the following assumptions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A collaborative relationship between the client and counselor is very important</li>
                        <li>
                            Our thinking or thought processes can create psychological distress, and if an individual is able to address the disturbances within their thinking,
                            then they can create meaningful change in their behavior, or how they act.
                        </li>
                        <li>CT can help a client address specific target behaviors because the premise is the behaviors exist because of certain beliefs or thoughts which exist.</li>
                    </ul>
                    CBT is widely researched and has been included in treatment programs throughout the country.
